# WhiteNoiseWithMax
Subproject for my Data Sonifier.

Generally, white noise is generated uniformly across the entire audible range...
But this doesn't have to be the case! 

This is normally-distributed white noise. You can easily edit the mean, standard deviation, and the number of randomly generated values.

(Implements a box-muller transform to generate random values)!

This is just a little piece of my next data sonification project, but on its own it's pretty cool (:
Here's a small demonstration!
